# localization and mapping
This repository contains jupyter notebooks elaborating algorithms that ultimately lead to the SLAM algorithm.
All examples are made after the explanations from: https://www.kalmanfilter.net

Alpha-Beta-Gamma Filter:
* Part 1: Weighting a gold bar 
* Part 2: Tracking a constant velocity aircraft in one dimension
* Part 3 Tracking an accelerating aircraft in one dimension

Kalman Filtr:
* Part 4: One-dimensional Kalman Filter without process noise
* Part 5: One-Dimensional Kalman Filterwith process noise
* Part 6: Estimating The Temperature Of A Heating Liquid
